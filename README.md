# PCA_LDA Project:
### Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are two data preprocessing linear transformation techniques that are often used for dimensionality reduction in order to select relevant features that can be used in the final machine learning algorithm. PCA is an unsupervised algorithm that is used for feature extraction in high-dimensional and correlated data. PCA achieves dimensionality reduction by transforming features into orthogonal component axes of maximum variance in a dataset. 

**Using PCA & LDA method of linear transformation on the given data(s).**
## Using python to solve for the following:

Given two files of the 2D data, for each file:

a) Plot the scatter plot.

b) Perform PCA for both the files (project on a single principal component).
Show the output scatter plot, and note the segregation in the 1D PCA space.

c) Perform LDA on the case, where segregation using PCA is not good ((project on a single LDA component).

> Show the output scatter plot, and note the segregation in the 1D LDA space.
