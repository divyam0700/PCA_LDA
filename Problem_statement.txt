Given two files of the 2D data, for each file:

a) Plot the scatter plot

b) Perform PCA for both the files (project on a single principal component)
Show the output scatter plot, and note the segregation in the 1D PCA space

c) Perform LDA on the case, where segregation using PCA is not good ((project on a single LDA component)

(Show the output scatter plot, and note the segregation in the 1D LDA space).
